# IRConverter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MagpieBridge/IRConverter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MagpieBridge/IRConverter)
This IRConverter converts [WALA](https://github.com/wala/WALA) intermediate representation (IR) to [Soot](https://github.com/Sable/soot) IR. This IRConverter enables you to analyze Java source code with Soot.  

## Why is this IRConverter needed? 
Soot comprises a solid Java bytecode front end. However, the bytecode only has the line numbers. This is not sufficient to support features such as hover, fix and codeLens in a code editor. For those features, position information about variable, expressions, calls and parameters are required, which are lost in bytecode. 

## How does this IRConverter work?
This IRConverter takes WALAâ€™s Java source-code front end to generate WALA IR (non-SSA) and convert it to Soot IR. Soot has multiple IRs, the most commonly used IR is called Jimple --- the IR considered by this IRConverter.

The following figure shows the IR statements considered by this IRConverter.

This IRConverter was developed for our paper: [MagpieBridge: A General Approach to Integrating Static Analyses into IDEs and Editors](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10813/pdf/LIPIcs-ECOOP-2019-21.pdf) (ECOOP 2019).
